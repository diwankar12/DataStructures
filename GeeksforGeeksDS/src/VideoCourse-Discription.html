============= Backtracking ===========

When there are many possibilities from given element and the answers could be many possible

===========Greedy============


==========Sorting=========

Bubble sort : we swap element in pass . if we have n elements in a array the pass will be n-1
basically we swap elements in each pass . Two loops one for pass and other for internal swapping
O(n2)

Selection sort : like heap sort , find the min element and put it at the first position .
in place algorithm
theta(n^2)

insertion sort : in place and stable . Good for small sized array .
 idea: take first element which is sorted and run loop from i=1 to end of array .
 Try to add the key into the sorted array . Worst case O(n^2) and best case O(n).

      (2nd Half) String
         1. Anagrams - Use hashmap to get the frequency
         2. Change a string in minimum step to anagram (hashmap)
         3. Check if string s2 is subsequence of s1 (two pointer approach)
         4. Given 2 strings s1 & s2 of same length . Check if s1 is a rotation of s2 or not :
            merge s1 + s1 and then find s2 in new string

Video 7 : LinkedList - insertion and deletion of SLL
Video 9 : Continuation of Linked List

   1. Slow(take 1 steps) and fast pointer(take 2 steps ) approach - find middle element of the SLL and detect cycle;
   2. Two pointer one to move k point until other move : delete the Kth element from the end of the SLL
   3. Detect Cycle or loop (Floyd's cycle detection)
          a. find loop : fast and slow pointer
          b. Find size of the loop : save the point where they meet and do one more round to
             find the size of the loop
          c. Find head : Move one pointer to the size of the loop , and then traverse other pointer parallel ,
             same as Kth element from end problem
   4. LRU cache - using doubly linked list and hashmap . HashMap will key as number and value as reference in DLL .
                  put : we will insert at the head and delete at the tail . We need to check first if the capacity of the DLL
                  If it is hashmap , move it to front and update the hashMap address
                  get operation : move the element at the head and delete the previous position and update the hashmap

          case 1: no children - directly delete it
          case 2: one children - take child to their parent
          case 3 : find inorder successor/predecessor and then replace it with the element and then delete it

   complete binary tree is called as binary heap , where each node satisfies heap property
   Binary Heap : for any node whose index is 'i' , left child = 2*i+1 and right child 2*i+2
                 for any node whose index is 'i' , its parent will be (i-1)/2
    Binary Heap have two parts Max Heap and min Heap .
    Max heap
       1. Max element is always at the top .
       2. We need to adjust the new element so that it follows heap rule , i.e parent is always bigger than child
          The process is called heapify or sift up

          a. getMax() - O(1)
          b. Insert() - O(logn) - sift up
          c. delete() -  O(logn) - siftDown (Swap current node witgh largest child , if it is smaller than largest child)

                 3. Sort a nearly sorted array

     ======= Algo Expert Heap Theory ===========

     Build Heap : using sift down method .
     insert : Using sift up method . Add a value at the last node and then compare with parent
              until the heap property is achieved .
      remove: Using sift down . When we remove a element from any node , it has to be swapped from last element
              Once it is swapped then the heap structure is broken . To make it a heap again , we compare parent and its
              two children , whichever is minimum we swapped the value with it . Keep doing it until all the heap properties
              is restored

Video 15 - GRAPH
      Bidirectional graph with n vertices and n-1 edges without cycles is called Tree .
      Directed Graph with n vertices and m edges has no cycle is called DAG .

      Representation of the Graph :
      1. By 2D matrix - Adjacency matrix - O(V^2)
      2. ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> - adjacency List - O(V+E)

      in a directed graph , dfs will not be able to visit all the vertices .
      We will be using in loop to call DFS to overcome above issue .

    DFS - use recursive call
    BFS - use queue and same like tree traversal , we just need to carry a boolean visited array .

    1. Min number of extra edges to make all the components into one
       Ans : components - 1
    2. Detect cycle in a undirected graph - using dfs and  we need to carry parent variable
    <code>


    </code>
    2. Detect cycle in a directed graph
         a. Using dfs approach - we need to carry boolean callStack and visited array
             The edge which is responsible for cycle formation are called as back edge ,
              which is only specific to DFS not BFS .

    Topological Sorting : linear ordering of all the vertices such that every pair in order u and v

         BFS based solution :
                               1. Store indegree of every vertex
                               2. Create a queue and add all 0 indegree vertices to the queue
                               3. for every adjacent v of u
                                   a. reduce indegree of v by 1
                                   b. If indegree of v becomes 0 , add v to the queue .

         DFS based solution :
                                1. Create an empty stack
                                2. For every vertex u ,
                                     if(u is not visited) call DFS(u,st)
                                3. While(st is not empty) pop all the element
                                4. DFS(u,st)
                                    1. mark u as visited
                                    2. for every adjacent v of u ,
                                            if v is not visited
                                                DFS(v,st)
                                    3. Push u to stack

          Topo sort - is valid only for directed graph . NOT valid for graphs which has cycles .
                     ONLY applicable for DAG .
                     Indegree : no of nodes coming to a node is called indegree
          NOTE : we can detect cycle using topo sort algorithm . Since the indegree of all the vertices will be one , it will never be 0
                 As a result it is not pushed to queue . We can put the check if the toposort collected in the list is
                 not equal to the vertices then it has cycle .

    NOTES 2 lecture:

    When we see a problem, it is very important to identify it as a dynamic programming problem. Generally (but not limited to) if the problem statement asks for the following:

    Count the total number of ways
    Given multiple ways of doing a task, which way will give the minimum or the maximum output.

    Steps To Solve The Problem After Identification

    Once the problem has been identified, the following three steps comes handy in solving the problem:

            1.Try to represent the problem in terms of indexes.
            2.Try all possible choices/ways at every index according to the problem statement.
            3.If the question states
                      a.Count all the ways – return sum of all choices/ways.
                      b.Find maximum/minimum- return the choice/way with maximum/minimum output.

=========================== BackTracking notes =====================

    Combination sum : we need to pick or not pick an element . Suppose we pick the element at particular index
                      then it doesn't move to next index beacause it can be picked multiple times

                       pseudo code :
                          picking
                                 add in ds // ds.add(arr[index])
                                f(ds,index,target-array[index])
                                 ds.remove(ds.size()-1)
                           not picking
                                f(ds,index+1,target)


    Combination Sum 2 : When element can be picked only once
                        then we need to do for loop , since there is chances of picking all element once




==================================================
<p>NOTE : Pass by value and Pass by reference <code>

    Pass By value : when using primitive type to pass in the method then primitive value is copied .
    Passing the value in the method and the value itself are different and they have different memory location

    Pass by reference : When using complex objects like arraylist, array , then the same value is passed to the object
