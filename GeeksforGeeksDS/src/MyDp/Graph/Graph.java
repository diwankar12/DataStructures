//    Suppose your Router sends a message. When a router
//    receives this message, it broadcasts the same message to all other routers
//    within its wireless range. Then, that router shuts down, and can no longer send
//    or receive messages.
//
//    For example,
//    Router A is at (0, 0);
//    Router B is at (0, 8);
//    Router C is at (0, 17);
//    Router D is at (11, 0).
//    If the wireless range is 10, when Router A
//    sends a message, it could first reach B; the message from Router B would further
//    reach Router C but Router D would never receive this message.
//
//    Given a list of routers' locations with x and y coordinates separated by :.
//    eg: "0:0" and range, return whether a message from source Router can reach destination Router. Write
//    a method / function with appropriate input and output arguments.
