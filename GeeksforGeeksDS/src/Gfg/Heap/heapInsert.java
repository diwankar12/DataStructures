   /*
     heapify : nodes which violates the binary heap property
     fix : get the minimum of the nodes in MinHeap and swap it
     inserts : add the node at the last and then swap with the parent until heap properties retained
     // extract max/min : first swap with last element and then do heapify . remove the last node which is min node .
     // heap sort : 1. If the elements are not in binary heap form then we need to make it binary heap
     by using buildHeap .
     2. Then we need to take the top element and swap to the bottom element
     3 . Andd then call heapify to rearrange it

     BUILDHEAP : its righmost bottom and then call heapify on each node , starting from botton right most

     External Sorting : 5 GB file to sort for 2 GB ram size , we use external sorting .
     First we divide into multiple files . and then we have k sorted files that we need to merge .
      There we use merge k sorted file
